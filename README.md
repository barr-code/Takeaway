Takeaway is the Week 2 Challenge at Makers Academy.
The task is to create a takeaway system that contains a menu of various items, which a person can order from.
Once the order is complete, the system should send a text using the Twilio API to confirm the order and give
an ETA for the food.

Built in Ruby using the Twilio gem.
