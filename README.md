# Takeaway: Week 2 Challenge at Makers Academy.
Task 1: create a takeaway system that contains a menu of various items, which a person can order from.
Once the order is complete, the system should send a text using the Twilio API to confirm the order and give
an ETA for the food.

Task 2: rewrite the Array class inject method in Ruby.

## Languages and Tools
```
  - Ruby
  - Rspec
  - Twilio
```

### To Open
Clone this repository.
```
  $ git clone git@github.com:barr-code/Takeaway.git
```

Change into the directory.
```
  $ cd Takeaway
```

### Run the Tests
```
  $ rspec
```

### What I Learned
The Takeaway challenge really helped to cement my understanding of using [rspec doubles](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks) in testing.

This was my first exposure to using Ruby gems and helped me to get my head around using an API in my code.

Rewriting the Inject method taught me about yielding to blocks within a method and helped me to understand the logic behind a powerful and widely used Ruby method.
